# Lazy Dev's Clipboard Butler üõ†Ô∏è

Why waste precious brainpower on repetitive tasks? This script is your clipboard's best friend and your personal cleanup crew. It listens for Git clone URLs, clones them into a folder named `NEWEVAL`, opens them in Visual Studio Code, and even deletes the folder if you quit. Oh, and it launches Chrome in incognito mode for good measure. All you have to do is copy, sit back, and type `q` when you're done. Who says laziness isn't productive?

## How to Use on macOS:

1. **Download the Script from GitHub**  
   Open your terminal and run the following commands:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raffitch/42-lazy-dev-butler.git
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**  
   Give the script permission to run:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x lazy-dev-butler.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**  
   Start the script by typing:  
   ```bash
   ./lazy-dev-butler.sh
   ```

4. **Enjoy Automation**  
   - Copy a Git URL to the clipboard, and the script will clone it automatically.  
   - Type `q` and press Enter to quit (it even cleans up after itself!).
